            <h3>Rewriting sentences such that it emphasizes the specific verb or action.</h3>
            <p>
              In this sentence verb/action emphasis task, you are given a sentence and a verb in the sentence to emphasize.
              Your task is to rewrite each sentence to emphasize the given verb action. If the rewrite is impossible or the given 
              emphasis isn't a verb or action, write capitalized "N/A" in the answer line.
            </p>
            <b>
                The verb action emphasis should be done by making the verb a noun and move it to the front. For example, "Big brown fox jumps over the sleazy dog"
                when "jumps" needs to be emphasized, the rewritten sentence should be "Jumping over the sleazy dog is done by the big brown fox"(See examples for more details)
            </b>
            <p>
                <b>Note that the original sentences will be without punctuations, and the re-written sentences should also not have punctuations.</b>
                <b>Other than punctuation, the rewritten sentence should be grammatically correct and free of misspelled words.
                Do not alter the meaning of the sentence. Do not change the tense of the sentence. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If the verb or action is already emphasized or such rewrite is impossible, write "N/A" as your answer.</b>
                For example, in "Introducing pool by Riley was effective" and emphasize "Introducing", "N/A" should be written because "Introducing" is already emphasized.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If the verb to emphasize occurs multiple times in a sentence, emphasize the first occurrance of the verb in the original sentence.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the verb to emphasize is inside a quote, just rewrite the quote part. (e.g. "He said I bought a red bird" goes to "He said the buying of a red bird was done by me")
                </p>
            <p><b>There are a lot more examples of what should be done and what should not be done in the "examples" tab. Please view them before starting the task.</b></p>
