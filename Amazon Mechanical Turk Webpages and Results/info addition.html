            <h3>Rewriting sentences such that it emphasizes the specific adjective.</h3>
            <p>
              Given a sentence and a new piece of information, rewrite the sentence such that the new piece of information is included.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note that the original sentences will be without punctuations, and the re-written sentences should also not have punctuations.</b>
                <b>Other than punctuation, the rewritten sentence should be grammatically correct and free of misspelled words</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If incorporating the information is impossible or if the information is already included in the original sentence, write "N/A" as your answer.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>After you rewrite the sentence, you need to review the sentence you wrote and determine if the sentence fits common sense, and check the "make sense" box accordingly.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the sentence "The cat is small" with info "['cat','large']" will be rewritten as "The large cat is small", which is grammatical but does not fit
                common sense, so the make-sense box should not be checked.
            </p>
            <p><b>There are a lot more examples of what should be done in the "examples" tab. Please view them before starting the task.</b></p>
