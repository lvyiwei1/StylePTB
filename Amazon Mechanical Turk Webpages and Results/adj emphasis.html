            <h3>Rewriting sentences such that it emphasizes the specific adjective.</h3>
            <p>
              Given a sentence and a specific adjective in the sentence, rewrite the sentence such that the adjective is now emphasized.
              The adjective should be emphasized by rewritting the entire sentence such that the main structure of the sentence is now a be-statement about the adjective.
              For example, "The big brown fox jumps over the sleazy dog", if we want to emphasize "sleazy", then it can be rewritten as "The dog that the big brown fox jumped over is sleazy".
              Do not attempt to emphasize the adjective using other methods (such as adding a "very" before the adjective).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note that the original sentences will be without punctuations, and the re-written sentences should also not have punctuations.</b>
                <b>Other than punctuation, the rewritten sentence should be grammatically correct and free of misspelled words</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If the adjective is already emphasized or such rewrite is impossible, write "N/A" as your answer.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>If the adjective to emphasize occurs multiple times in a sentence, emphasize the first occurrance of the adjective in the original sentence.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the adjective to emphasize is inside a quote, just rewrite the quote part. (e.g. "He said I saw a red bird" goes to "He said the bird I saw was red")
                </p>
            <p><b>There are a lot more examples of what should be done and what should not be done in the "examples" tab. Please view them before starting the task.</b></p>
